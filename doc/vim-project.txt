vim-project.txt    For acristoffers/vim-project Last change: 2020 Jun 20

Manages projects, like emacs. Only three functions:

:ProjectAdd            (`<leader>pa`) adds the current directory* to the list of
                       projects.

:ProjectRemove         (`<leader>pr`) remove the current directory* from the
                       list of projects.

:ProjectOpen           (`<leader>po`) opens a selection list so you can choose a
                       project. Vim will cd to it, delete all buffers, and run
                       `Files` if fzf is installed or `Explore` otherwise.
